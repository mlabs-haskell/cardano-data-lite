Certificate.Kind:
	CSL crams the RegCert and StakeRegistration into a single class StakeRegistration.
	Same for UnregCert and StakeDeregistration.
	The API to construct the Certificate type still has separate constructor for these, 
	so users who construct, deconstruct and otherwise interact with the Certificate type is unaffected.
	But user's who inspect the value of Certificate.kind() will see that CSL has the same value for some variants,
	while CDL has unique values for each variant.

	We decided to do it this way because it's easier to reason about and maintain.
	They are distinct types in conway.cddl as well.
	In addition, we are API compatible with CSL except for the kind() method.

PointerAddress:
	We have removed support for PointerAddress because CSL doesn't use them and
	generally it's rarely used. We will add this later if needed.
