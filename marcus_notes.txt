# Missing types

- [X] Languages: Missing `static list(): Languages` - should we worry?
- [X] Pointer : There are basicaly duplicated methods for `number` and `BigNum`. Should we keep only the `BigNum`s?
- [X] PlutusMapValues: verify if `type: array` with `item: PlutusData` is enough/okay
- [X] Update: Verify - `Update` looks like `UnitInterval`. I'm not sure what `tagged` does in `UnitInterval`. Do we need it on `Update` as well?
- [X] Voters: seems to make sense to be of type `array`, however in CSL we have `get(index: number): Voter | undefined`, while for type `array` we only return `Voter`. Should we worry about this difference?
- [X] GovernanceActionIds: same note as above.
- [X] PlutusMap
- [X] ProposedProtocolParameterUpdates

- [ ] TreasuryWithdrawals: has `insert`, `keys` and `lens`. `insert` here returns `void`, while in other functions it returns `a | undefined`. Clarify this difference and how it relates to serialization
- [ ] VotingProcedures: same note as `TreasuryWithdrawals`, plus has additional methods.
