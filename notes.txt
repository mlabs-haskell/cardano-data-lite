# Goals

- Typesafety for the user . 
	Provide as much bug-proofing as possible at compile time.

- Typesafety for developer.
	Make the library as bug-free as possible.

# Approaches

- Typescript type-level DSL:

	Build a base DSL to represent all CBOR types.

	Write functions which can use this DSL to parse CBOR in a typesafe way.

	Use this to model conway.cddl

- Parser, Schema with Value level DSL
	
	Developer needs to write typesafe interfaces/classes for each type in conway.cddl
	Then manually map it to a schema.
	The DSL should make it somewhat easier, but the developer needs to ensure
	that the schema matches the CDDL file accurately.
